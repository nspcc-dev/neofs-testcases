# Contribution guide

First, thank you for contributing! We love and encourage pull requests from
everyone. Please follow the guidelines:

- Check the open [issues](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-testcases/issues) and
  [pull requests](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-testcases/pulls) for existing
  discussions.

- Open an issue first, to discuss a new feature or enhancement.

- Write tests, and make sure the test suite passes locally.

- Open a pull request, and reference the relevant issue(s).

- Make sure your commits are logically separated and have good comments
  explaining the details of your change.

- After receiving feedback, amend your commits or add new ones as appropriate.

- **Have fun!**

## Development Workflow

Start by forking the `neofs-testcases` repository, make changes in a branch and then
send a pull request. We encourage pull requests to discuss code changes. Here
are the steps in details:

### Set up your GitHub Repository

Fork [NeoFS testcases upstream](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-testcases/fork) source
repository to your own personal repository. Copy the URL of your fork and clone it:

```shell
$ git clone <url of your fork>
```

### Set up git remote as ``upstream``

```shell
$ cd neofs-testcases
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-testcases
$ git fetch upstream
```

### Set up development environment

To setup development environment for `neofs-testcases`, please, take the following steps:
1. Prepare virtualenv

```shell
$ virtualenv --python=python3.9 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install all dependencies:

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Setup pre-commit hooks to run code formatters on staged files before you run a `git commit` command:

```shell
$ pre-commit install
```

Optionally you might want to integrate code formatters with your code editor to apply formatters to code files as you go:
* isort is supported by [PyCharm](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15434-isortconnect), [VS Code](https://cereblanco.medium.com/setup-black-and-isort-in-vscode-514804590bf9). Plugins exist for other IDEs/editors as well.
* black can be integrated with multiple editors, please, instructions are available [here](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html).

### Create your feature branch

Before making code changes, make sure you create a separate branch for these
changes. Maybe you will find it convenient to name branch in
`<type>/<issue>-<changes_topic>` format.

```shell
$ git checkout -b feature/123-something_awesome
```



### Commit changes

After verification, commit your changes. There is a [great
post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) on how to write useful commit
messages. Try following this template:

```
[#Issue] Summary
Description
<Macros>
<Sign-Off>
```

```shell
$ git commit -am '[#123] Add some feature'
```

### Push to the branch

Push your locally committed changes to the remote origin (your fork):
```shell
$ git push origin feature/123-something_awesome
```

### Create a Pull Request

Pull requests can be created via GitHub. Refer to [this
document](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) for
detailed steps on how to create a pull request. After a Pull Request gets peer
reviewed and approved, it will be merged.

## Code Style

The names of Python variables, functions and classes must comply with [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008) rules, in particular:
* Name of a variable/function must be in snake_case (lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability).
* Name of a global variable must be in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, the underscore (`_`) symbol must be used as a separator between words.
* Name of a class must be in PascalCase (the first letter of each compound word in a variable name is capitalized).
* Names of other variables should not be ended with the underscore symbol.

Line length limit is set as 100 characters.

Imports should be ordered in accordance with [isort default rules](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/).

We use `black` and `isort` for code formatting. Please, refer to [Black code style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html) for details.

Type hints are mandatory for library's code:
 - class attributes;
 - function or method's parameters;
 - function or method's return type.

The only exception is return type of test functions or methods - there's no much use in specifying `None` as return type for each test function.

Do not use relative imports. Even if the module is in the same package, use the full package name.

To format docstrings, please, use [Google Style Docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html). Type annotations should be specified in the code and not in docstrings (please, refer to [this sample](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#type-annotations)).

## DCO Sign off

All authors to the project retain copyright to their work. However, to ensure
that they are only submitting work that they have rights to, we are requiring
